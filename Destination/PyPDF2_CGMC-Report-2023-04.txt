Net performance is calculated based upon a hypothetical unrestricted, full fee-paying “Main Class” investor who came in at inception. Investment results shown are for taxable and tax-exempt accounts. Any possible tax liabilities incurred by the taxable accounts are not reflected in net performance. An actual client’s results may vary due to the timing of capital transactions, high watermarks, and performance. Performance results are time weighted and reflect the deduction of advisory fees, brokerage commissions, and other expenses that a client would have paid,and include the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.

The strategy invests globally across equities, commodities, fixed income securities and currencies. The strategy employs both long and short positions and may use leverage.

In addition. the Global Macro Fund invests alongside Crescat’s Precious Metals Fund following its friendly activist investment strategy in the precious metals mining industry as just one of its thematic components. Risks related to this strategy are described in the Global Macro Fund’s private placement memorandum. BenchmarksThe S&P 500 Index is perhaps the most commonly followed stock market index.
