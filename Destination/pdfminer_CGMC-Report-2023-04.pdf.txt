Important Disclosures

Phone:  (303) 271-9997

Crescat Capital LLC manages hedge funds and separate  accounts through its wholly owned subsidiary, Crescat Portfolio Management LLC, an investment adviser registered with the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission. Registration as an investment adviser does not imply a certain level of skill or training. 

Crescat Portfolio Management claims compliance with Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). Prospective clients can obtain a compliant presentation and the firm’s list of composite 
descriptions by contacting Crescat by phone at (303) 271-9997, or by visiting our website at www.crescat.net/resources/due-diligence/. "Crescat Global Macro" in this report refers to the Crescat Global 
Macro Hedge  Fund Composite. Returns are presented net of management fees  and performance fees.  The currency used to express performance is U.S. dollars. Performance data represents  past 
performance and is no guarantee of future results. GIPS® is a registered trademark of CFA Institute.  CFA Institute does not endorse or promote this organization, nor does it warrant the accuracy or

Strategy and Composite Description

The Crescat Global Macro Hedge Fund includes all accounts that are managed according to Crescat’s global macro hedge fund strategy over which it has full discretion. Net performance is calculated based 
upon a hypothetical unrestricted, full fee-paying “Main Class” investor who came in at inception. Investment results shown are for taxable and tax-exempt accounts. Any possible tax liabilities incurred by 
the taxable accounts are not reflected in net performance. An actual client’s results may vary due to the timing of capital transactions, high watermarks, and performance. Performance results are time 
weighted and reflect the deduction of advisory fees,  brokerage commissions, and other expenses that a client would have paid, and include the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings. Hypothetical 
performance should not be considered indicative of the skill of Crescat, and clients may experience a loss. The Global Macro Fund comprises Crescat’s most versatile portfolio strategy with exposure to all 
of Crescat’s macro themes. The strategy invests globally across equities, commodities, fixed income securities and currencies. The strategy employs both long and short positions and may use leverage. 
Positioning is determined largely by Crescat’s proprietary multi-factor macro and fundamental equity quant models, with the goal of identifying and capitalizing on secular trends. Positioning is adjusted on 
a discretionary basis using Crescat’s thematic investment framework. The strategy typically invests across five to ten macro themes at any one time. In addition. the Global Macro Fund invests alongside 
Crescat’s Precious Metals Fund following its friendly activist investment strategy in the precious metals mining industry as just one of its thematic components. Risks related to this strategy are described in 
the Global Macro Fund’s private placement memorandum. 

Benchmarks

The S&P 500 Index is perhaps the most commonly followed stock market index. It is considered representative of the US stock market at large. It is a market-cap-weighted index of the 500 largest and most 
liquid companies listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ  exchanges. While the companies are U.S. based, most of them have broad global operations. Therefore, the index is representative of the broad global 
economy. It is a suitable benchmark for the Crescat Global Macro Hedge Fund Composite which has also traded extensively in large, highly liquid global equities through U.S.-listed securities.
The HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index represents a broad universe of hedge funds with the capability to trade a range of asset classes  and investment strategies across the global securities markets. The  index 
is weighted based on the distribution of assets in the global hedge fund industry. It is a trade-able index of actual hedge funds. It is a suitable benchmark for Crescat’s Global Macro Hedge Fund Composite 
which has also traded in multiple asset classes and applied a multi-disciplinary investment process since inception. 
Returns for the S&P 500 Total Return Index and HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index include the reinvestment of income and do not include transaction fees, management fees  or any other costs. The 
performance and volatility of the funds will be different than those of the indexes. Benchmarks are provided to represent the investment environment in existence during the time periods shown.

Bloomberg News, eVestment, and Capital Finance International Award Disclosure

Bloomberg and eVestment peer analysis and selection criteria is based on returns. The Bloomberg return table was compiled from people familiar, investor letters and other Bloomberg News reporting. 
The report is written by editor Melissa Karsh of Bloomberg News to acknowledge returns for month and year to date. Crescat Capital did not submit payment, outside of our employees’ Bloomberg and 
eVestment subscriptions, for consideration or placement in these rankings. Our ranking may not be representative of any one client’s experience since it reflects the returns of a hypothetical, full fee-
paying investor who has invested since inception. Ranking is not indicative of future performance. The displayed table is based on US submissions only and the number of submissions varies on a week-by-
week basis. Crescat reports performance estimates and finalized numbers to Bloomberg and eVestment as they are released  and displays both favorable and unfavorable months at the discretion of the 
Bloomberg News team. Crescat Capital is not affiliated with Bloomberg News.
Crescat was awarded the Best Global Macro Investment Strategy US 2021 by an expert judging panel at Capital Finance International (“CFI”). The judging panel’s full report can be found here. Crescat 
Capital did not submit payment for consideration of the award and is not affiliated with CFI. The CFI judging panel uses a wide range of criteria to help it reach informed decisions. In granting an award, 
some of the more important factors taken into consideration are risk management, performance and value creation, quality and permanency of investment team, investment strategy, analytics and 
research, innovation, client service, and strength of nominations.  CFI readers, subscribers and staff  working for organizations that contribute and support CFI’s publication voted for Crescat to be 
nominated. Then, CFI’s judging panel, using the factors above, granted Crescat the award. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
